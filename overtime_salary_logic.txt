[NOTE #1] The federal rate is 0.5 only in cases of weighted average or multiple pay rates, otherwise, 1.5 .
[NOTE #2] Assuming more than 40 hours is overtime.

a. Overtime pay for hourly employees

- Fixed hourly pay:

    1) calculate base pay: x * total working hours excluding overtime [x = pay rate]
    2) calculate overtime rate of pay: x * 1.5
    3) calculate overtime pay: overtime rate of pay * overtime hours
    4) calculate total pay: base pay + overtime pay

- Multiple pay rates (Day and Night shifts):

    1) Calculate base pay: (total hours on Day shifts * day shift pay rate) + (total hours on Night shifts * Night shift pay rate)
    2) Calculate regular rate of pay: Base pay / total hours of day shifts and Night shifts without overtime
    3) Calculate overtime premium rate: regular rate of pay * 0.5
    4) calculate total overtime premium pay: overtime premium rate * overtime hours 
    5) Total pay: Base pay + total overtime premium pay 

- Multiple pay rate with 40 hours as regular:
    1) Calculate base pay: (total hours on Day shifts * day shift pay rate) + (total hours on Night shifts * Night shift pay rate)
    2) Calculate weighted regular rate of pay: Base pay / total hours of day shifts and Night shifts with overtime
    3) Calculate overtime premium rate: weighted regular rate of pay * 0.5
    4) calculate total overtime premium pay: overtime premium rate * overtime hours [overtime hours = total hours - 40]
    5) Recalculate base pay (if > 40): 40 * weighted regular rate of pay 
    6) Total pay: Base pay + total overtime premium pay 

b. Overtime pay when earning a salary

- Fixed work week [Fixed pay, e.g, $400/week] :

    1) Calculate regular rate of pay: Base pay / hours worked per week
    2) Calculate overtime premium rate: regular rate of pay * 1.5
    3) calculate overtime premium pay: overtime premium rate * overtime hours 
    4) Total pay: Base pay + overtime premium pay 

- Fluctuating work week :

    1) Calculate regular rate of pay: Base pay / total hours in a work week (includes overtime hours)
    2) Calculate overtime premium rate: regular rate of pay * 0.5
    3) calculate overtime premium pay: overtime premium rate * overtime hours (total hours - 40)
    4) Total pay: Base pay + overtime premium pay 

c. Overtime pay for non-hourly compensation

- Piece-rate work
    
    1) Calculate regular rate of pay: the piece rate earning / the number of hours worked
    2) Calculate overtime premium rate: regular rate of pay * 0.5
    3) calculate overtime premium pay: overtime premium rate * overtime hours 
    4) Total pay: the piece rate earning + overtime premium pay
