Inputs:

payRate: The hourly wage rate, e.g., $10/hour.
baseHours: The maximum number of standard hours worked in a week before overtime is calculated (typically up to 40 hours).
basePay: The total payment for standard hours worked in a week.
overTimeRate: The rate at which overtime is paid. This is generally 1.5 times the regular hourly rate.
federalRate: The federal rate for overtime calculation. It is 0.5 in cases where a weighted average or multiple pay rates are used, otherwise it is 1.5.
overTimePay: The total payment for overtime hours.
overHours: The number of hours worked beyond the baseHours, which are considered overtime.

Outputs:

basePay: Total payment for standard hours worked in a week.
overtimeRate: The effective overtime rate applied for calculating overtime pay.
overtimePay: Total payment for overtime hours worked.
totalPay: Total payment for the week, including both standard and overtime pay.

limitations or restrictions that affect the problem : 

1. Performance Considerations:
Volume of Data: If the payroll system needs to process pay calculations for a large number of employees, the system's performance can be impacted. Batch processing of payroll might slow down, especially during peak periods like the end of a pay period.
Real-Time Processing: Some payroll systems might require real-time calculations for adjustments or on-demand pay requests. Ensuring quick and accurate calculations under such conditions can be challenging.
Complexity of Calculations: Employees with multiple pay rates, bonuses, deductions, or varying overtime rates can complicate the calculation, potentially slowing down the system if not optimized properly.

2. Scalability Issues:
Growing Workforce: As the number of employees grows, the payroll system needs to scale accordingly. A system designed for a small business might struggle to handle calculations for a large corporation.
Integration with Other Systems: Payroll systems often need to integrate with timekeeping, HR, and accounting systems. As these systems grow and change, ensuring that the payroll system scales and adapts accordingly can be challenging.
Geographical Considerations: If the company operates in multiple regions or countries, the payroll system needs to handle different regulations, currencies, and tax systems. This adds complexity and can limit scalability if not designed for international use.

3. Resource Constraints:
Computational Resources: Running complex payroll calculations can be resource-intensive, requiring adequate computing power, especially in environments with multiple overtime rates, varying deductions, and bonuses.
Data Accuracy: Maintaining accurate and up-to-date data is critical. Inaccurate inputs (like incorrect hourly rates or overtime hours) can lead to incorrect pay calculations, which can have legal and financial repercussions.
Legal Compliance: The system must comply with labor laws and regulations, which can vary widely by jurisdiction. Changes in these laws may require updates to the payroll system, potentially straining resources to ensure ongoing compliance.

4. Legal and Compliance Restrictions:
Overtime Rules: Different jurisdictions have different rules for overtime pay. Some regions might have strict definitions of overtime, and failure to comply can result in penalties.
Tax Withholding: Tax laws vary, and the payroll system must account for various tax brackets, deductions, and contributions. Ensuring compliance with these laws is essential.
Data Privacy: Payroll data is sensitive, and there are strict regulations around how it is stored and processed (e.g., GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California). Ensuring that the system adheres to these privacy laws is critical.

5. Technical Limitations:
Legacy Systems: Many payroll systems run on outdated technology, which can limit the ability to implement new features or optimize performance.
Data Integration: Ensuring seamless integration between different systems (e.g., time tracking, benefits management) can be challenging, particularly when dealing with legacy systems or external vendors.
Error Handling: Proper error handling mechanisms need to be in place to manage incorrect data inputs, calculation errors, or system failures. Inadequate error handling can lead to incorrect pay and potential legal issues.

6. User and Usability Concerns:
Ease of Use: Payroll systems need to be user-friendly, as payroll administrators may not have a technical background. Complex interfaces or processes can lead to user errors.
Training Requirements: If the system is complex, it might require significant training for users, which can be a resource and time burden.
Customization Needs: Different companies might have unique payroll needs (e.g., different overtime policies, bonus structures), and the system must be flexible enough to accommodate these without significant rework.
